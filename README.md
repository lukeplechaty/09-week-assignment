- basic requirements

  - Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk --done
  - Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesn’t exist.
  - Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind).
  - users to create a user profile --done
  - Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page.

- stretch goals
  - Allow users to update their content. You can achieve this either with a dynamic route (“/posts/[id]/edit”) or by creating a modal.
  - Allow users to delete their content.
  - Allow users to view other profiles directly from posts they see on the global timeline, using a dynamic users route.
  - Let users follow each other by establishing a follower and followee relationship between profiles.
  - Enable users to like posts by linking their user_id to the liked_post in a junction table.
  - Ensure that a user’s biography cannot be left blank --done
  - Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits another users profile that doesn’t exist.
